# The Body Mass Index (BMI) measures the body fat using the weight and height of a person. 
#The BMI is used to classify adults into categories as in the following table.

#solicit user's weight input
 
weight = input("Enter your weight in \'kg\': ")
height = input("Enter your height in \'m\': ")

#convert the inputs from string to float
weight_int = float(weight)
height_int = float(height)

#calculate  BMI = weight (in kilograms) / height (in meters) ^2
bmi = weight_int/(height_int *2)

if (bmi > 0 ) and (bmi < 18.5):
    print("Underweight")
elif (bmi >= 18.5 ) and (bmi <= 24.9):
    print("Normal Weight")
elif (bmi >= 25 ) and (bmi <= 29.9):
    print("Overweight")
elif (bmi >= 30 ):
    print("Obese")
else:
    print("Your weight can\'t be calculate")
